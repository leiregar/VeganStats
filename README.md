# VeganStats

Each day, a person who eats a vegan diet saves 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq ft of forested land, 20 lbs CO2 equivalent, and one animalâ€™s life.

VeganStats allows you to enter the date you went vegan and track your positive impact in real-world numbers.  

VeganStats also provides motivational notifications based on the time you have been vegan.

New vegans can receive messages of support as they make their way through their first days, weeks and months of being vegan.  

Long-term vegans can receive notifications on the anniversary of the day they went vegan, as well as when they reach certain environmental and compassionate milestones.
